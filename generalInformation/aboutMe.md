## About me

I am an aspiring software tester gaining hands-on experience through individual mentoring, focused on practical skills and real-world IT project challenges. Iâ€™m not only learning testing tools and techniques but also developing a testerâ€™s mindset - quality-driven, detail-oriented, and collaborative.<br/>

My work emphasizes quality assurance (QA) in Agile (Scrum) projects, along with growing skills in requirement analysis, test design, and defect reporting in a way that supports developers.<br/>

### What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far?<br/>

ðŸ”¹ **I understand the testerâ€™s role in Agile teams** - how to advocate for quality from the early stages and communicate effectively with Product Owners and developers.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I analyze user stories and help refine acceptance criteria, working with product backlogs and configuring basic Jira settings**.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I design test cases** - creating scenarios for happy/sad paths and edge cases, ensuring requirement coverage and traceability. Tools Iâ€™ve used: Zephyr, Xray, and TestRail.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I report defects clearly and thoroughly, with efficient debugging in mind** - I know what developers need.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I can work without advanced test management tools, creating templates for test cases and bug reports to stay effective even in less automated environments**.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **Iâ€™m familiar with ATDD, BDD, and shift-left approaches** - I see the value of early QA involvement in requirement analysis.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I perform exploratory testing** - using mind maps, analyzing the dev console, and conducting session-based testing with test charters.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I create test documentation in Confluence or Notion, ensuring it supports the entire dev team**.<br/>
ðŸ”¹ **I know the basics of UX and digital accessibility testing** - I understand the importance of usability and inclusivity.<br/>

Currently, Iâ€™m preparing for the ISTQB CTFL 4.0 certification (planned for June). I already have a theoretical foundation, but more importantly, I know how to apply it in practice.
