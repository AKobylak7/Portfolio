## **My past expierience:**

Previously, I gained experience in knowledge management, instructional design, and e-learning development. My expertise included:

ðŸ”¹ Creating and organizing knowledge bases for analysts and end users,<br>
ðŸ”¹ Developing diverse training materials (videos, graphics, presentations, documentation),<br>
ðŸ”¹ Designing and maintaining intranet sites (from concept to implementation and updates),<br>
ðŸ”¹ Building interactive e-learning courses (from needs analysis to UI/UX design, testing, and publication).<br>

For these tasks, I used tools like Articulate Storyline, Adobe Illustrator, Camtasia, and web technologies.

This experience taught me to be attentive to user needs and committed to product qualityâ€”skills I now apply to software testing.
